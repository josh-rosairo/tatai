How to run:
1) Navigate to the folder this file is currently in, using File Manager.
2) Right-click and choose "open Terminal here".
4) Enter the command "sudo apt install openjfx" to install JavaFX.
3) Enter the command "bash run.sh" to run Tatai.

Step 3 can be replaced with running the command "bash path/to/run.sh" in Terminal, replacing path/to/run.sh with the path to run.sh in your directory system.
